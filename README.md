# RH-Investment-Summary

WIP - Currently writes a summary of your stock portfolio and gains on Robinhood to a spreadsheet in Google Drive

# How to use it:
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab (Colab does not cost anything; all you need is a google account)
2. Run each block of code
3. In the final block, provide your account details and other necessary user inputs. You can retrieve the MFA key from your app if you have 2FA enabled - this is the same key that you enter in authenticator apps like Google Authenticator.
4. The code presents you with the summary view inline and exports a csv file with the raw data to your Google drive

# Next Steps:
1. Account for options
2. Account for wash sale
3. Add UI layer
